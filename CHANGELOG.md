# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Rebuilt the guided setup as a stepped wizard: numbered progress headers, a
  toggleable provider list with live ready/needs-key/needs-sign-in status,
  `a`/`n` select-all/none shortcuts, invalid-input recovery instead of
  aborting, color when the terminal supports it (respecting `NO_COLOR`), and a
  review summary with explicit confirmation before anything is installed.
- Guided Codex setup can now onboard Grok OAuth (and offers to `npm install`
  a missing official provider CLI), matching what the Cursor setup and tray
  already supported.
- Added a reversible tray toggle that lets signed-out Codex CLI/App sessions
  use connected external providers through a managed custom model provider,
  while preserving ChatGPT credentials and restoring the prior provider mode.
- The macOS login-free toggle now gracefully restarts the registered Codex app
  after applying or restoring its model-provider mode.
- Grok OAuth injects bare hosted `web_search` and `x_search` tools so xAI can
  run server-side realtime search agentically, matching Grok Build. Router-side
  search env filters and request search-parameter mapping were removed.
- Use Thinking Orbs `Shaping` while idle, `Thinking` while generating, and
  `Solving` for the Island's error indicator.
- Replace compact provider names with the providers' published marks and Codex
  session titles, add a plain `+N` concurrent-session indicator, and show dark
  hover rows with live status, elapsed time, daily usage, and ping-pong overflow
  for long titles.
- Added a native Windows and Linux tray companion with a seven-day token graph,
  connected-provider quota cards, secure onboarding, an animated top-center
  activity pill on Windows/X11, and an explicit tray-only Wayland fallback.
- Balanced the Dynamic Island with an animated status dot and slow idle
  heartbeat, a clearer localized pulse and edge comet during generation, and a
  one-shot line-chart draw while preserving Reduce Motion behavior.
- Restored the Dynamic Island's daily line graph with today's token total and
  provider quota percentage, while leaving longer-range controls in the tray.
- Hide tray usage cards until the corresponding OAuth session or API key is
  configured; enabled providers and historical local traffic no longer create
  disconnected-account cards.
- Cleaned up tray quota cards so each window has one standardized limit label
  and one reset line, with five-hour windows shown separately from weekly
  limits in both current and all-provider usage.
- Fixed All usage cards so local traffic with request counts no longer shows
  "No use", and local-only providers show "Local router traffic" instead of
  "No reset reported".
- Surface concurrent Codex model requests on the Dynamic Island: active count,
  multi-provider compact labels, and live request rows with elapsed time.
- Added a credential-isolated Anthropic API provider with Claude Opus 4.8 in
  the Codex picker, native Anthropic Messages forwarding, secure key setup,
  tray controls, and a real LiteLLM-to-mock-Anthropic Codex integration test.
- Added the macOS menu-bar control panel, all-provider usage grid, and optional
  Dynamic-Island-style activity overlay with secure provider onboarding.
- Made tray usage selection account-aware, added quota reset times to provider
  cards, and kept Kimi and Grok OAuth sessions fresh during usage polling and
  routed requests.
- Made macOS service reinstalls wait for launchd to finish unloading and use an
  in-place restart, preventing transient bootstrap status-5 failures.
- Serialized background-service changes and added bounded readiness checks so
  repairs cannot overlap or report failure while a healthy router is starting.
- Added a 30-second `Starting` grace state to the macOS tray so routine router
  recovery does not appear as an immediate failure.
- Added the isolated Cursor target and corrected its PowerShell installer path.
- Removed the experimental Claude Desktop router target while retaining the
  direct, credential-isolated Anthropic API provider for Codex and Cursor.
- Fixed partial startup failures so already-running forwarders are terminated,
  and isolated all six ports in the real LiteLLM integration test.
- Grok OAuth account usage now reads weekly/monthly credit limits from the official Grok CLI billing endpoint.
- Rewrote routed-model catalog identity text so external models no longer
  claim to be based on GPT-5 in Codex `base_instructions`.
- Hardened local caller authentication with a separate per-install capability,
  exact internal-key checks, authenticated credential-detail health endpoints,
  browser-request rejection, and fail-closed routing before request bodies or
  provider quota are touched.
- Protected Codex config and all config snapshots for the current user, and
  redacted the caller capability from status, migration, and support output.
- Replaced raw exception text in HTTP responses and service logs with bounded,
  non-sensitive errors.
- Fixed Windows private-file ACL grants for numeric user SIDs and corrected
  router-status detection for escaped Windows catalog paths.

## 0.3.0

- Added guided, provider-aware setup for Kimi OAuth, Kimi API, and DeepSeek API.
- Added safe detection, snapshots, automatic migration, and exact rollback for
  the two recognized earlier Kimi router layouts.
- Added macOS launchd, Linux systemd-user, and Windows Task Scheduler services,
  plus a native PowerShell installer and command wrapper.
- Added provider visibility and runtime enforcement so hidden external models
  cannot be mistaken for native models.
- Added `doctor --fix`, privacy-safe support bundles, update rollback, guarded
  provider model discovery, and billed compatibility tests.
- Added cross-platform CI, dependency audits, tagged source archives, SHA-256
  checksums, and GitHub build-provenance attestations.
- Expanded zero-knowledge onboarding, installation, security, troubleshooting,
  and future-provider documentation.

## 0.2.0

- Generalized the original Kimi-only prototype into a validated provider/model
  registry.
- Added separate Kimi OAuth, Kimi API, and DeepSeek API routes while preserving
  native Codex models and ChatGPT authentication.
